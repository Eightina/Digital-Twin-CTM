% There are three types of diverge:

% 2. Type 1 indicates traffic flow turns right.
% 3. Type 2 indicates traffic flow turns left.

% 2. Column (2) specifies the type of intersection:

% 2. Columns (3)(4) are the coordinates of intersection.
% 3. Columns (5)(6) are the minimum and maximum green time respectively.
% 4. Columns (7) is 1 if right turning traffic flow is allowed in any phase, otherwise 0.
% 5. Columns (8) is the number of phase at the intersection.
% 6. Column (9) contains all the nodes connected at the intersection.
