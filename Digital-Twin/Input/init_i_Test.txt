% Traffic demands as follow:
%                (1)         (2)       (3)
%               start      origin    traffic

demand        08:00:00        5        0.1389

% Traffic demand at origin node (2) equals (3) from time (1) on.
%
% Traffic diverges as follow:
%             (1)      (2)       (3)       (4)
%             from     to       diverge

diverge        3        4        1.0        0

% Percentage (3) of traffic flow enters arc (2) from arc (1).
% There are three types of diverge:
% 1. Type 0 indicates traffic flow goes through straight.
% 2. Type 1 indicates traffic flow turns right.
% 3. Type 2 indicates traffic flow turns left.
% 
% Traffic merges as follow:
%           (1)      (2)
%           from     to
%           arc      arc
