% Test input file of Green Signal
% Draft Version
% Apr 1, 2008
% 
% Format of the input file: 
% 1. The input file has ordinary ".txt" file name extension and its file name begins with "i_", e.g. the file you are reading is named "i_Test.txt".
% 2. "%" is the comment symbol in this input file. The program should ignore any line beginning with a percentage symbol.
% 3. Any expression begins with a keyword, e.g. setting, time, initoccp.
% 4. Every section (see below) begins with a expression only containing a keyword (e.g. setting) and ends with keyword "end".
% 5. The sequence of expressions within section is insensitive, i.e. changes of sequence of expressions in a section make no difference.
% 
% Sections of the input file: 
% 1. Setting parameters. In this part, the general simulation information is included.
% 2. Geometry structure. The scale and topology of the traffic network are presented here.
% 3. Control scheme. The scheme consist of the location of intersection, approaching arcs, maximum (minimum) green time, phase, etc.
% 4. Traffic flow. Traffic demand, diverging and merging are presented here.
% 5. Event information. This section describes any event that changes the capacity and jam density of particular arc.

setting
% Section I - Setting parameters.
time 08:00:00 08:16:40
% The beginning and end time of the simulation run
clock 4
% The discrete time interval between clock ticks. The unit of time is second.
epsilon 0.01
% Any quantities smaller than epsilon will be ignored.
initoccp 5
% The initial cell occupation percentage.
initctrl 0
% The initial control strategy: 
% 0 - every phase length is assigned the minimum green time and the cycle length is minimum green time multiplied by number of phase.
% 1 - both phase length and cycle length are fixed according to Webster's formula.
cellscale 1
% Cell lenth factor.
losttime 4
% Lost time.
